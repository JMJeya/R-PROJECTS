## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
vh <- read_excel("vhData.xlsx")
vh1 <- vh[ ,c(1, 4:17)] ### subset the table without the 2nd and 3rd row.  The resulting table will have the accession ID and the PSM values for all the samples.
vh2 <- column_to_rownames(vh1, var = "Accession")  ### renaming a column to rownames has to be done to a new object.  column_to_rownames does not work on if it is applied to be done on the same table.  The renaming has to generate a new table
vh3 <- data.matrix(vh2) ### convert the data.frame to a numerical matrix for heat map

heatmap(vh3, scale = "row") ### normalization based on values across the row

### Hierarchical clustering to see the grouping among the samples

vhDist <- dist(t(vh3), method = "minkowski", diag = TRUE, upper = TRUE, p = 2)
vhClust <- hclust(vhDist, method = "complete")
plot(vhClust)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
vh <- read.csv("VH5-5-4.csv")
vh
vh1 <- vh[ ,2:30]
vh1
vh2 <- column_to_rownames(vh1, var = "accNo") 
vh2
vh3 <- data.matrix(vh2) ### convert the data.frame to a numerical matrix for heat map

heatmap(vh3, scale = "row") ### normalization based on values across the row

### Hierarchical clustering to see the grouping among the samples

vhDist <- dist(t(vh3), method = "euclidean", diag = TRUE, upper = TRUE, p = 2)
vhClust <- hclust(vhDist, method = "average")
plot(vhClust)
```
